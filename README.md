## IPC 
The re-engraved version of the Apple XPC service is mainly used for inter-process communication during Apple development. The interface usage is basically the same as that of XPC. 

## Features 
1. Re-engraving the XPC interface makes it easy for developers to get started.
2. Support cross-device multi-threaded communication, XPC only supports native inter-process communication. 

## Usage scenario 
1. I don't want to use XPC communication. 
2. Communicate across devices. 
3. The sandbox application communicates with Daemon.
